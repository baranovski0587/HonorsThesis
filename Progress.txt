As of 10/28/2024

	Managed to find where to download PRISM climate data. Downloaded average DAILY temperature data for every 4 by 4k grid into yearly folders from 1981-2019. Can download dewpoint as well. Started work on aggregation:
		1.)Temp files in .bil format, raster data
		2.)Extrapolate temp, transformation matrix, coordinate system, and the bounds
		3.)Mask missing data (stored as-9999), take valid indices 
		4.)Convert valid indices to coordinates 
	Conversion to data frame is infeasible, 1 day of data takes about 15-60 seconds each. 481k rows for one day. Extract relevant info, perform necessary transformations, link to county boundaries and THEN aggregate. 

	Current plan (to be verified by 1 file then by 1 year):
		1.)Loop through every year, aggregate by month, every day
		2.)Aggregate temperature to county: 
			a.)How to determine county borders? use historic county lines? Use address?
			b.) Struggling to find older county line borders, only until 2007?
			c.) If center square point falls into county lines, belongs to county.
			d.) for each county: find weighted average of daily temperature for all grid points within a county, where the values for each grid point are weighted by the inverse of the squared distance from the grid point to the countyâ€™s population centroid.
				i.) Centroids only back to 2000

		3.) Calculate daily heat index (will look at other vars first) for each county
			a.) Use similar process in 2.) with dew point to calculate humidity
